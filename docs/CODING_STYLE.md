### Main Folders and Content

#### 📂 public

This folder contains publicly accessible media assets and data that can be served over HTTP.

- `/images` — Stores image files such as .png, .jpg, .svg, and other common formats.
- `/icons` — Contains reusable SVG icons for the app or website interface.
- `/data` — Holds medium-sized data files like text placeholders and structured content used for display or demo purposes.

#### 📂 src/assets

 Contains media and other static assets used directly within the React application.

- `/fonts` — Includes custom font files used in the UI.
- `/images` — Stores image files such as .png, .jpg, .svg, and similar formats.
- `/data` — Holds small-sized, static data such as hardcoded menu items or mock content.

#### 📂 src/components

 Contains general-purpose, reusable React components shared across all `📂 features`.

- `/layout` — Includes layout components that use `<Outlet />` with React Router, as well as full-page layout wrappers that accept {children} as props.
- `/ui` — Contains small, reusable UI elements and widgets such as input fields, date pickers, notifications, and similar components.

#### 📂 src/lib

 Contains shared scripts, configurations, and utilities used throughout the app.

- `/config` — Configuration files and setup definitions, such as settings for third-party integrations.
- `/hooks` — Reusable React hooks that can be used across the app (e.g., `useDebounce()`). Also includes hooks used by `📂 components` like ui or layout.
- `/services` — Contains logic for making asynchronous HTTP requests (CRUD operations) to external RESTful APIs.
   - `apiRoutes.ts` — Centralized definitions for all remote API endpoint URLs used in the app.
- `/store` — Contains state management logic (e.g., Zustand or Redux slices and definitions).
- `/utils` — General-purpose utility functions, such as date formatters and other helpers.

#### 📂 src/features

Organizes self-contained features of the app. Each subfolder represents a complete, independent feature composed of related logic and UI components.

- **Co-location** — Each feature folder may include its internal structure such as `/components`, `/hooks`, `/stores`, and `/styles`. Co-location simplifies finding feature-related files as the code base grows larger.

- **Access Rules (Enforced by `no-restricted-imports` ESLint Rule):**
   - **🔒 From outside the `/features` folder**
      - Only import feature entry components from the top-level @/features path.
         ```typescript
         ✅ import { About, Contact } from "@/features"
         ❌ import About from "@/features/About/About"
         ❌ import About from "../../features/About/About"
         ```
   - **🔒 From inside the `/features` folder**
      - Use relative imports when referencing other components, either within the same feature or across features.
         ```typescript
         ❌ import { About, Contact } from "@/features"
         ✅ import About from "../About/About"
         ```

#### 📂 src/styles

Contains generic custom CSS definitions used by the whole app.

- `app.css` — Contains **Tailwind CSS** customizations and other global style overrides.
- `fonts.css` — Defines custom font imports used across the app.
- `typography.css` — Includes global typography styles such as font families, sizes, and weights.
- `index.css` — The main entry point for global styles. It imports **Tailwind CSS** along with `app.css`, `fonts.css`, `typography.css`, and other custom styles.

## 📌 Coding Practices and Guidelines

> [!NOTE]
> The React app follows the [**container-component pattern**](https://www.patterns.dev/react/presentational-container-pattern/) (also known as the container/presentational) pattern, where **logic and data processing are handled in React hooks** (containers) while **components are focused only on rendering UI** (components).

#### 📐 General Coding Guidelines

- Use **arrow functions** instead of traditional function declarations when defining React components.
- Follow **camelCase** for naming variables, files, and folders.
- Always define the **types** of function parameters and return values. Use TypeScript **interfaces** or **types** for generic parameters when applicable.
- Implement features using a **co-located structure** within the `📂 src/features` directory.
- Define new **page-level components** by registering them in the `📄 /src/routes.ts` file.
- Aim to keep each source file—whether a React component, hook, or utility script—**under approximately 300 lines of code**. If a file exceeds this size, **consider refactoring** it into smaller, more focused files to improve clarity and maintainability.
- Store constant values (e.g., strings or numbers) in **well-named variables** to improve readability and maintainability.
   ```typescript
   ✅ const DISCUSSIONS_API = "/api/v1/discussions"
       fetch(DISCUSSIONS_API)
   ❌ fetch("/api/v1/discussions")
   ```

#### ⚛️ React Components

- Keep React components focused on **UI (JSX/HTML)** with minimal logic. Whenever possible, separate logic and data handling into custom **React hooks** (`"containers"`), and use components solely for rendering.
- Name **component files and function names** using **PascalCase** (e.g., `FeatureOne.tsx`).
- Use **TypeScript interfaces or types** to define props instead of PropTypes.
- Make good use of **component composition** — build small, focused components that can be composed together. Avoid defining multiple components in a single file.
- Place **globally reusable UI or layout components** in the `📂 /src/components` (ui or layout) subfolders.

#### ⚡ Rendering Optimization

- Avoid complex expressions (e.g., ternary conditions, computations) directly inside the return() block of a React component. Instead, compute values beforehand and store them in named variables for cleaner, more readable JSX.
- Use `useMemo()` and `useCallback()` to memoize values and functions where appropriate, especially when passing props to child components or dealing with expensive computations.
- Observe the React profiler from the [React Developer Tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) to determine which component/s may need rendering optimizations from time to time.

#### 📄 Code Documentation

- Use **JSDoc-style comments** to document function parameters, return types, and TypeScript type or interface definitions.
- Add **minimal but meaningful inline comments** where necessary to clarify intent, especially for complex or non-obvious logic.
- Use **descriptive and self-explanatory variable names** to reduce the need for excessive comments and improve overall code readability.

#### 📦 Use of External Libraries

- Strive to **minimize external dependencies**, especially for simple or easily implementable functionality (e.g., a function that sums two numbers).
- Only use third-party Node libraries when **truly necessary**—for example, when a library:
   - Provides functionality that would be complex or time-consuming to build from scratch
   - Is used frequently across the app
   - Helps avoid "reinventing the wheel" for heavy processing tasks
- Before adding a library, consider the following 🟢 green flags:
   - It comes from a **credible author or organization**, with an active and trustworthy GitHub repository
   - It has **high usage** and community trust (e.g., ~100K+ downloads on the NPM registry)
   - It has **small and lightweight footprint** (eg., about ~300KB-2MB unpacked) or if it supports **tree-shaking**.
   - The source code is **open, transparent, and actively maintained** (eg., few open GitHub Issues or PRs)
   - Even if not actively maintained, the library still **aligns with your needs** and is simple enough to extend or adapt for custom use (e.g., a JavaScript `class` that can be easily refactored or subclassed (`extend`) for custom use)
