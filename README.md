## vitexperiments

This repository, featuring a simple app that has a sticky **Navigation Menu Bar** and three (3) empty pages (**Home**, **About**, **Login** and **Contact**) contains random Frontend, CSS and React experiments using [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

Its folder structure, setup and organization will serve as go-to reference for similar TypeScript React apps created with Vite, or others that use the `react-router-dom`.
