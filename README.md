## vitexperiments

This repository, featuring a simple app that has a sticky **Navigation Menu Bar** and three (3) empty pages (**Home**, **About**, **Login**, and **Contact**) contains random Frontend, CSS, and React experiments using [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

Its folder structure setup and organization will serve as a go-to reference for similar TypeScript React apps created with Vite, or general React apps that use the **React Router** for routing.

   git clone https://github.com/weaponsforge/vitexperiments.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies.<br>
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## üìñ Usage

Using Node

1. Run the React app for local development.<br>
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Launch the local app website in a web browser at:<br>
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Edit the source code and wait for changes to display in the web browser.

4. To build the React app, run:<br>
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This command exports the build artifacts to the¬†`/app/dist`¬†directory.

## ‚ö°Alternate Usage

<details>
<summary>Using Docker</summary>
<br>

> **IMPORTANT**
> Ensure that port `3000` is free before proceeding.

1. Build the image for local development.<br>
   ```sh
   docker compose build --no-cache
   ```

   > **INFO:** Re-run this step if there will be changes to the Dockerfile or after installing new Node libraries.

2. Run the container for local development.<br>
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```

3. Launch the local app website in a web browser at:<br>
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Edit the source code and wait for changes to display in the web browser.

5. To build the React app:<br>
   - Ensure the container is running.
   - Open another command terminal and run:<br>
      ```sh
      docker run exec -it weaponsforge-vitexperiments npm run docker:build
      ```

      This command exports the build artifacts to the¬†`/app/dist`¬†directory.
