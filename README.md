## vitexperiments

This repository contains a simple React frontend application built with [‚ö°Vite](https://vite.dev/). It serves as a personal reference for client-side React coding patterns and conventions, particularly for projects that use **React Router**.

The folder structure, setup, and general coding style reflect how I like to [organize TypeScript React apps](/docs/CODING_STYLE.md) built with Vite, or for any React projects that use **React Router** for routing (including the retired [ü™¶Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) (CRA)).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository.<br>
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/weaponsforge/vitexperiments.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies.<br>
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **When using Docker on a `Windows OS` host**: (Optional) Create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` file and uncomment/enable the `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING` and `CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL` variables to enable hot reload.

   | Variable Name | Description |

   | CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING | Enables hot reload on `nodemon` running inside Docker containers on a Windows host. Set it to true if running Docker Desktop with WSL2 on a Windows OS. |
   | CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL | Chokidar polling interval. Set it along with `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` if running Docker Desktop with WSL2 on a Windows OS. The default value is `1000`. |

## üìñ Usage

Using Node

1. Run the React app for local development.<br>
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Launch the local app website in a web browser at:<br>
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Edit the source code and wait for changes to display in the web browser.

4. To build the React app, run:<br>
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This command exports the build artifacts to the¬†`/app/dist`¬†directory.

5. Run the lint and build scripts to ensure new code updates follow this repository's coding conventions.<br>
   Lint
   ```sh
   # Checks and fixes lint errors
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

   Build
   ```sh
   # Runs tsc for checking type errors before building the app
   npm run build
   ```

   > **INFO:** This project uses **ESLint** for code linting and formatting. Rules are defined in `eslint.config.js`.

## ‚ö°Alternate Usage

<details>
<summary>Using Docker</summary>
<br>

Usage with Docker is an alternate option to using Node directly from the [Usage](#-usage) section.

> **IMPORTANT**
> Ensure that port `3000` is free before proceeding.

### Build the Development Docker Image

1. Set up the environment variables for the `/app` directory. Refer to the [Installation](#Ô∏è-installation) section **# 3** for more information.

2. Build the image for local development.<br>
   ```sh
   docker compose build --no-cache
   ```

   > **INFO:** Do this step only once during initial installation. Re-run this step if there will be changes to the Dockerfile or after installing new Node libraries.

3. Run the container for local development.<br>
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```

4. Launch the local app website in a web browser at:<br>
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. Edit the source code and wait for changes to display in the web browser.

6. To build the React app:<br>
   - Ensure the container is running.
   - Open another command terminal and run:<br>
      ```sh
      docker run exec -it weaponsforge-vitexperiments npm run docker:build
      ```

      This command exports the build artifacts to the¬†`/app/dist`¬†directory.

7. To run tyests:<br>
   ```sh
   # More Docker NPM scripts are available
   docker run exec -it weaponsforge-vitexperiments npm test
   ```

8. (Alternate) build command without using Docker compose:<br>
   ```
   # Using PowerShell
   docker run -it -v ${pwd}/app:/opt/app -v /opt/app/node_modules --env-file ./app/.env --rm weaponsforge/vitexperiments npm run docker:build
   ```

9. To stop the Docker container:<br>
   ```sh
   docker compose down
   ```

### Use Pre-Built Development Docker Image

This project deploys the latest **development** Docker image to Docker Hub on the creation of new Release/Tags. It is available at:

https://hub.docker.com/r/weaponsforge/vitexperiments

1. Pull the pre-built development Docker image using any of the two (2) options:
   - Open a terminal and run:<br>
      ```sh
      docker pull weaponsforge/vitexperiments
      ```

   - Navigate to the `/vitexperiments` root project directory, then run:<br>
      ```sh
      docker compose pull
      ```

2. Run the development image. Follow the steps under [Build the Development Docker Image](#build-the-development-docker-image) starting from **step #3**.

## üìú Available Scripts

These Node scripts, compatible with running in Node and Docker, run Vite React processes for local development.

### `npm run dev`

- Runs the app for local development.
- This script has a counterpart in the [üê≥ Docker Scripts](#-docker-scripts) section (`npm run docker:dev`)¬†for running in a Docker container.

### `npm run build`

- Runs type-checking with `tsc` then proceeds to build or bundle the React app into optimized static assets for deployment into the `/app/dist` directory.
- This script has a counterpart in the [üê≥ Docker Scripts](#-docker-scripts) section (`npm run docker:build`)¬†for optimally building the app from a Docker container.

### `npm run lint`

Lints TypeScript source codes and checks for linting errors.

### `npm run lint:fix`

Fixes lint errors.

### `npm run preview`

- Displays the React app build output at `http://localhost:4173/`
- It requires running `npm run build` first
- (Currently not supported with the Docker setup)

### `npm test`

- Runs test scripts defined in `*.test.ts` files with coverage.
- Generates a vitest test report into the `/html` directory.
- Run npm `run report:view` to preview the generated report.

### `npm run test:watch`

### `npm run report:view`

> **NOTE:** This script requires running `npm test` first to generate a test report into the `/html` directory

- Spins up a local web server accessible at `http://localhost:4174/`
- Serves the website contents of a test report from the **/html** directory

<br>

## üê≥ Docker Scripts

These scripts allow optional Docker-related processes, such as enabling file watching in Docker containers running in Windows WSL2 and others.
